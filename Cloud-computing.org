* What is Cloud-computing?
  - Services and solutions that are deliverd and consumed in real time over
    internet are cloud services
    + When you store your photos, online, use webmail or a social networking
      site, you are using "cloud computing" service
  - Cloud computing is a delivery model of computing services over the internet
    + It enables real time development, deployment and delivery of broad range
      of products, services and solutions.
  - This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three
    service models, and four deployment models.
** Characteristics
  * On demand self service
  * *Ubiquitous network access:* Anywhere, Anytime and Anydevice
  * Location independent Resource Pooling
  * Rapid Elasticity
  * Pay as you go
** Service Models:
  * SaaS(Software as a Service)
  * Paas(Platform as a Service)
  * IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service)
** Deployment Models:
  * Private Cloud
  * Comunity Cloud
  * Public Cloud
  * Hybrid Cloud
* Supporting Factors for Cloud Computing
  - Combined affect of following factors have made cloud computing a compelling
    paradigm
    + Advancement in processors
    + Virtualization Technology
    + Distributed Storage
    + Automated Management
    + Broadband internet Access
    + Fast and Inexpensive servers
* Evolution of Computing
Computing has progressed through 5 key phases, over last 6 decades
  + Mainframe
  + PC
  + Client Server
  + Web Services
  + Cloud
* Advantages of Cloud Computing
 * *Scalability/Elasticity*
  + Capability to handle most sudden, temporary peaks in application demand on
    cloud infrastructures
 * *Cost saving/less capital expenditure*
  + Reducing up-front IT cost or capital expenditure to buy server machines, no
    need for hiring/training manpower.
 * *Higher resource Utilization*
  + Reduces the time required to provision resources to minutes, allowing
    applications to quickly scale under-utilization both up and down, as the
    workload changes.
 * *Business agility*
  + Allows business to respond to peaks/lows in demands better. E.g. Online
    shops, which have to handle their peak loads at festival times. University
    websites, which have to handle their peak loads during exam result time.
 * *Disaster recovery and Back up*
  + Cloud Services have very high availability of ~99.9999%, by proactively by
    taking backups, having stand-by virtual resources in place and moving
    failed instances of Virtual resources across seamlessly
* Why use Cloud Computing?
Clouds can provide users with a number of different benefits.

Many businesses large and small use cloud computing today either directly
(e.g. Google or Amazon) or indirectly (e.g. Twitter) instead of traditional
on-site alternatives. There are a number of reasons why cloud computing is so
widely used among businesses today.
 * *Reduces TCO*
  + Savings on Capital Investment
  + Savings on Data Center Space, Power and Cooling
  + Minimizes Operational costs
 * *Up to date software* 
  + A cloud provider will also be able to upgrade software keeping in mind
    feedback from previous software releases.
 * *Universal access*
  + Cloud computing can allow remotely located employees to access applications
    and work via the internet.
 * *Choice of applications*
  + This allows flexibility for cloud users to experiment and choose the best
    option for their needs. Cloud computing also allows a business to use,
    access and pay only for what they use, with a fast implementation time
 * *Flexibility*
  + Cloud computing allows users to switch applications easily and rapidly,
    using the one that suits their needs best. However, migrating data between
    applications can be an issue.
 * *Potential to be greener and more economical*
  + The average amount of energy needed for a computational action carried out
    in the cloud is far less than the average amount for an on-site
    deployment. This is because different organisations can share the same
    physical resources securely, leading to more efficient use of the shared
    resources.
 * *Better Budget Utilization*
  + Re-invest saved Capex on new initiatives
  + Focus on business, not on infrastructure
  + Save on operations manpower
* Deployment Models:
** Private Cloud
  + Operated solely for an organization
  + May be managed by the organization or a third party
  + Limits access to enterprise and partner network
  + Retains high degree of control, privacy and security
** Comunity Cloud
  + shared infrastructure by several organizations which have shared concerns
  + May be managed by the organizations or a third party
  + Costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud
** Public Cloud
  + Owned and managed by service provider
  + Made available to the general public or a large industry group
** Hybrid Cloud
  + Composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) bound
    together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and
    application portability
