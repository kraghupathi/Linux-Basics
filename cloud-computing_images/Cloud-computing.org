* What is Cloud-computing?
  - Services and solutions that are deliverd and consumed in real time over
    internet are cloud services
    + When you store your photos, online, use webmail or a social networking
      site, you are using "cloud computing" service
  - Cloud computing is a delivery model of computing services over the internet
    + It enables real time development, deployment and delivery of broad range
      of products, services and solutions.
  - This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three
    service models, and four deployment models.

* Supporting Factors for Cloud Computing
  - Combined affect of following factors have made cloud computing a compelling
    paradigm
    + Advancement in processors
    + Virtualization Technology
    + Distributed Storage
    + Automated Management
    + Broadband internet Access
    + Fast and Inexpensive servers
* Evolution of Computing
Computing has progressed through 5 key phases, over last 6 decades
  + Mainframe
  + PC
  + Client Server
  + Web Services
  + Cloud
* Advantages of Cloud Computing
 * *Scalability/Elasticity*
  + Capability to handle most sudden, temporary peaks in application demand on
    cloud infrastructures
 * *Cost saving/less capital expenditure*
  + Reducing up-front IT cost or capital expenditure to buy server machines, no
    need for hiring/training manpower.
 * *Higher resource Utilization*
  + Reduces the time required to provision resources to minutes, allowing
    applications to quickly scale under-utilization both up and down, as the
    workload changes.
 * *Business agility*
  + Allows business to respond to peaks/lows in demands better. E.g. Online
    shops, which have to handle their peak loads at festival times. University
    websites, which have to handle their peak loads during exam result time.
 * *Disaster recovery and Back up*
  + Cloud Services have very high availability of ~99.9999%, by proactively by
    taking backups, having stand-by virtual resources in place and moving
    failed instances of Virtual resources across seamlessly
* Why use Cloud Computing?
Clouds can provide users with a number of different benefits.

Many businesses large and small use cloud computing today either directly
(e.g. Google or Amazon) or indirectly (e.g. Twitter) instead of traditional
on-site alternatives. There are a number of reasons why cloud computing is so
widely used among businesses today.
 * *Reduces TCO*
  + Savings on Capital Investment
  + Savings on Data Center Space, Power and Cooling
  + Minimizes Operational costs
 * *Up to date software* 
  + A cloud provider will also be able to upgrade software keeping in mind
    feedback from previous software releases.
 * *Universal access*
  + Cloud computing can allow remotely located employees to access applications
    and work via the internet.
 * *Choice of applications*
  + This allows flexibility for cloud users to experiment and choose the best
    option for their needs. Cloud computing also allows a business to use,
    access and pay only for what they use, with a fast implementation time
 * *Flexibility*
  + Cloud computing allows users to switch applications easily and rapidly,
    using the one that suits their needs best. However, migrating data between
    applications can be an issue.
 * *Potential to be greener and more economical*
  + The average amount of energy needed for a computational action carried out
    in the cloud is far less than the average amount for an on-site
    deployment. This is because different organisations can share the same
    physical resources securely, leading to more efficient use of the shared
    resources.
 * *Better Budget Utilization*
  + Re-invest saved Capex on new initiatives
  + Focus on business, not on infrastructure
  + Save on operations manpower
* Cloud Computing Infrastructure
Cloud infrastructure consists of servers, storage devices, network, cloud
management software, deployment software, and platform virtualization.
[[./cloud_computing-cloud_infrastructural_components.jpg]]
 * *Hypervisor*
Hypervisor is a firmware or low-level program that acts as a Virtual Machine
Manager. It allows to share the single physical instance of cloud resources
between several tenants.

 * *Management Software*
It helps to maintain and configure the infrastructure.

 * *Deployment Software*
It helps to deploy and integrate the application on the cloud.

 * *Network*
It is the key component of cloud infrastructure. It allows to connect cloud
services over the Internet. It is also possible to deliver network as a utility
over the Internet, which means, the customer can customize the network route
and protocol.

 * *Server*
The server helps to compute the resource sharing and offers other services such
as resource allocation and de-allocation, monitoring the resources, providing
security etc.

 * *Storage*
Cloud keeps multiple replicas of storage. If one of the storage resources
fails, then it can be extracted from another one, which makes cloud computing
more reliable.

 * *Infrastructural Constraints*
Fundamental constraints that cloud infrastructure should implement are shown in
the following diagram:
[[./cloud_computing-cloud_infrastructural_constraints.jpg]]
 * *Transparency*
Virtualization is the key to share resources in cloud environment. But it is
not possible to satisfy the demand with single resource or server. Therefore,
there must be transparency in resources, load balancing and application, so
that we can scale them on demand.

 * *Scalability*
Scaling up an application delivery solution is not that easy as scaling up an application because it involves configuration overhead or even re-architecting the network. So, application delivery solution is need to be scalable which will require the virtual infrastructure such that resource can be provisioned and de-provisioned easily.

 * *Intelligent Monitoring*
To achieve transparency and scalability, application solution delivery will need to be capable of intelligent monitoring.

 * *Security*
The mega data center in the cloud should be securely architected. Also the control node, an entry point in mega data center, also needs to be secure.
* Service Models
** SaaS(Software as a Service)
Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.

[[./SaaS.jpg]]
*** Characteristics:
  * *The Payoff:* SaaS customers have no hardware or software to buy, install, maintain, or update. Access to applications is easy: You just need an Internet connection.
  
  - A good way to understand the SaaS model is by thinking of a bank, which protects the privacy of each customer while providing service that is reliable and secure—on a massive scale. A bank’s customers all use the same financial systems and technology without worrying about anyone accessing their personal information without authorisation.

A “bank” meets the key characteristics of the SaaS model:

  * *A multitenant architecture:* A multitenant architecture, in which all users and applications share a single, common infrastructure and code base that is centrally maintained. Because SaaS vendor clients are all on the same infrastructure and code base, vendors can innovate more quickly and save the valuable development time previously spent on maintaining numerous versions of outdated code.
  * *Easy Customization:* The ability for each user to easily customise applications to fit their business processes without affecting the common infrastructure. Because of the way SaaS is architected, these customisations are unique to each company or user and are always preserved through upgrades. That means SaaS providers can make upgrades more often, with less customer risk and much lower adoption cost.
  * *Better Access:* Improved access to data from any networked device while making it easier to manage privileges, monitor data use, and ensure everyone sees the same information at the same time.
  * *Harnesses The Consumer Web:* Anyone familiar with Amazon.com or My Yahoo! will be familiar with the Web interface of typical SaaS applications. With the SaaS model, you can customise with point-and-click ease, making the weeks or months it takes to update traditional business software seem hopelessly old fashioned.
  * *Updates are automated:* whenever there is an update it is available online
    to existing customers, often free of charge. No new software will be
    required as it often is with other types of applications and the updates
    will usually be deployed automatically by the cloud provider.
  * *SaaS Trends:* Organisations are now developing SaaS integration platforms (or SIPs) for building additional SaaS applications. The consulting firm Saugatuck Technology calls this the “third wave” in software adoption: when SaaS moves beyond standalone software functionality to become a platform for mission-critical applications.
*** Benefits
Using SaaS has proved to be beneficial in terms of scalability, efficiency, performance and much more. Some of the
benefits are listed below:
  + Modest Software Tools
  + Efficient use of Software Licenses
  + Centralized Management & Data
  + Platform responsibilities managed by provider
  + Multitenant solutions
*** SaaS Examples
Google-Mail, Drive Calendar etc., Twitter, Facebook and Flickr etc. are all
examples of SaaS, with users able to access the services via any internet
enabled device. Enterprise users are able to use applications for a range of
needs.
** Paas(Platform as a Service)
  + PaaS is a category of cloud computing that provides a platform and
    environment to allow developers to build applications
  + Allows users to create software applications using tools supplied by the
    provider. PaaS services can consist of preconfigured features that
    customers can subscribe to; they can choose to include the features that
    meet their requirements
  + The infrastructure and applications are managed for customers and support
    is available.
  + Services are constantly updated, with existing features upgraded and
    additional features added.
  + PaaS providers can assist developers from the conception of their original
    ideas to the creation of applications, and through to testing and
    deployment.
[[./PaaS.png]]
*** Key PaaS Offerings:
  + Operating system
  + Server-side scripting environment
  + Database management system
  + Server Software
  + Support
  + Storage
  + Network access
  + Tools for design and development
  + Hosting
*** PaaS Advantages
  * *No investiment in Infrastructure:*
   + Being able to ‘rent’ virtual infrastructure has both cost benefits and
     practical benefits.
   + No need to purchase hardware or employ the expertise to manage it. Focus
     on the development of applications.
  * *Makes Development/Quality Content Creation possible for ‘non-experts’*
   + With some PaaS offerings anyone can develop an application. They can
     simply do this through their web browser utilising one-click functionality.
   + Salient examples of this are one-click blog software installs such as
     WordPress.
  * *Flexibility*
   + Customers can have control over the tools that are installed within their
     platforms or create a platform that suits their specific requirements.
   + Allows to ‘pick and choose’ the features that are necessary.
  * *Adaptability*
   + Features can be changed if circumstances dictate that they should.
   + Teams in various locations can work together; as an internet connection
     and web browser are all that is required
   + Developers spread across several locations can work together on the same
     application build.
  * *Security*
   + Security is provided, including data security and backup and recovery.

*** PaaS examples
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Cloud Foundry, CloudControl, Cloudera, EngineYard,
Google App Engine
** IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service) 
IaaS also known as HaaS (Hardware as a Service) provides access to computing
resource in a virtualised environment:
[[./IaaS.png]]

  + Virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, IP addresses and load
    balancers.
  + Physically, the pool of hardware resource is pulled from a multitude of
    servers and networks usually distributed across numerous users/clients.
  * *Hypervisor* - also known as a virtualization manager, virtual machine
    monitor (VMM), or platform virtualizer - is a specialized operating system
    that only runs virtual machines. A hypervisor running multiple virtual
    machines enables what seems like multiple computers to run in a single
    physical computer, enabling the virtual computers to share the physical
    computer's hardware resources.
[[./Hypervisor.png]]
  * *Virtualization*- Virtualization is the creation of flexible substitutes
    for actual resources. The substitutes, called virtual resources, have the
    same functions and external interfaces as their actual counterparts but
    that differ in attributes such as size, performance, and cost.
  * Virtualization is commonly applied to physical hardware resources by
    combining multiple physical resources into shared pools from which users
    receive virtual resources. With virtualization, you can make one physical
    resource look like multiple virtual resources. The virtual resources can
    have functions or features that are not available in their underlying
    physical resources.
  * System virtualization is most commonly implemented with hypervisor
    technology.
  * Hypervisors are software or firmware components that can virtualize system
    resources
  * There are broadly two types of hypervisors:
    + *Type 1:* Also called ‘Native’ or ‘bare metal’ Hyper visors - that run
      directly on HW. 

    E.g. Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, the Citrix
    XenServer, VMware ESX/ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V 2008/2012.
    + *Type 2:* Also called ‘Hosted’ Hypervisor - that require a Host OS to run.

    E.g. VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, bhyve and KVM.
[[./Type1 &2 hypervisor.png]]
*** Virtual Machine and Virtual Appliances
  * *Virtual Machine:* A virtual machine behaves like a real machine, so that
    an OS, or other program written to run alone on a real machine, when
    running on the Virtual Machine, acts as if it is running on a real bare
    machine by itself.
  * *Virtual Appliance:* A virtual appliance or virtual application represents
    a pre-configured VM, or a collection of pre-configured, interdependent VMs,
    each bundled with a fully-functional OS (operating system), known as a
    guest OS, and one or more applications.
  * Virtual appliances are portable, self-contained configurations of a
    software stack. They are also called virtual images and are usually built
    to host a single business application. The industry standard for the format
    of virtual appliances is the Open Virtualization Format (OVF), published by
    the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Member companies such as IBM,
    VMware, Citrix, Microsoft, and Oracle all support OVF in their products.
[[./virtual-application.png]]
*** Cloud Mechanism: Auto Scaling
  * *Auto Scaling*
   + User creates a Virtual Server.
   + Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) allocates Physical Server
   + Virtual Server usage increases above 80% of CPU capacity > 60 Sec
   + Automated Scaling Listner running at Hypervisor detects need to scale-up
     and commands VIM accordingly
[[./autoscaling.png]]
*** IaaS Examples
Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service
(Amazon S3), Rackspace Cloud Servers, GoGrid, Joyent, and AppNexus
** Example Cloud Services
  * *Cloud Services*
[[./cloud-services.png]]
* Deployment Models:
** Public Cloud
Public Cloud allows systems and services to be easily accessible to general
public. The IT giants such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft offer cloud services
via Internet. The Public Cloud Model is shown in the diagram below.
[[./cloud_computing-public_cloud_model.jpg]]
*** Benefits
There are many benefits of deploying cloud as public cloud model. The following
diagram shows some of those benefits:
[[./cloud_computing-public_cloud_model_benefits.jpg]]
 * *Cost Effective*
Since public cloud shares same resources with large number of customers it turns out inexpensive.

 * *Reliability*
The public cloud employs large number of resources from different locations. If any of the resources fails, public cloud can employ another one.

 * *Flexibility*
The public cloud can smoothly integrate with private cloud, which gives customers a flexible approach.

 * *Location Independence*
Public cloud services are delivered through Internet, ensuring location independence.

 * *Utility Style Costing*
Public cloud is also based on pay-per-use model and resources are accessible whenever customer needs them.

 * *High Scalability*
Cloud resources are made available on demand from a pool of resources, i.e., they can be scaled up or down according the requirement.

*** Disadvantages
Here are some disadvantages of public cloud model:

 * *Low Security*
In public cloud model, data is hosted off-site and resources are shared publicly, therefore does not ensure higher level of security.

 * *Less Customizable*
It is comparatively less customizable than private cloud.
** Private Cloud
Private Cloud allows systems and services to be accessible within an
organization. The Private Cloud is operated only within a single
organization. However, it may be managed internally by the organization itself
or by third-party. The private cloud model is shown in the diagram below.
[[./cloud_computing-private_cloud_model.jpg]]
*** Benefits
There are many benefits of deploying cloud as private cloud model. The
following diagram shows some of those benefits:
[[./cloud_computing-private_cloud_model_benefits.jpg]]

 * *High Security and Privacy*
Private cloud operations are not available to general public and resources are shared from distinct pool of resources. Therefore, it ensures high security and privacy.

 * *More Control*
The private cloud has more control on its resources and hardware than public cloud because it is accessed only within an organization.

 * *Cost and Energy Efficiency*
The private cloud resources are not as cost effective as resources in public clouds but they offer more efficiency than public cloud resources.

*** Disadvantages
Here are the disadvantages of using private cloud model:

 * *Restricted Area of Operation*
The private cloud is only accessible locally and is very difficult to deploy globally.

 * *High Priced*
Purchasing new hardware in order to fulfill the demand is a costly transaction.

 * *Limited Scalability*
The private cloud can be scaled only within capacity of internal hosted resources.

 * *Additional Skills*
In order to maintain cloud deployment, organization requires skilled expertise.
** Comunity Cloud
Community Cloud allows system and services to be accessible by group of
organizations. It shares the infrastructure between several organizations from
a specific community. It may be managed internally by organizations or by the
third-party. The Community Cloud Model is shown in the diagram below.
[[./cloud_computing-community_cloud_model.jpg]]
*** Benefits
There are many benefits of deploying cloud as community cloud model.
[[./community_cloud_model_benefits.jpg]]
 * *Cost Effective*
Community cloud offers same advantages as that of private cloud at low cost.

 * *Sharing Among Organizations*
Community cloud provides an infrastructure to share cloud resources and capabilities among several organizations.

 * *Security*
The community cloud is comparatively more secure than the public cloud but less secured than the private cloud.

 * *Issues*
  + Since all data is located at one place, one must be careful in storing data
    in community cloud because it might be accessible to others.

  + It is also challenging to allocate responsibilities of governance, security
    and cost among organizations.
** Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid Cloud is a mixture of public and private cloud. Non-critical activities
are performed using public cloud while the critical activities are performed
using private cloud. The Hybrid Cloud Model is shown in the diagram below.
[[./cloud_computing-hybrid_cloud_model.jpg]]
*** Benefits
There are many benefits of deploying cloud as hybrid cloud model. The following
diagram shows some of those benefits:
[[./cloud_computing-hybrid_cloud_model_benefits.jpg]]
 * *Scalability*
It offers features of both, the public cloud scalability and the private cloud
scalability.

 * *Flexibility*
It offers secure resources and scalable public resources.

 * *Cost Efficiency*
Public clouds are more cost effective than private ones. Therefore, hybrid clouds can be cost saving.

 * *Security*
The private cloud in hybrid cloud ensures higher degree of security.

*** Disadvantages
 * *Networking Issues*
Networking becomes complex due to presence of private and public cloud.

 * *Security Compliance*
It is necessary to ensure that cloud services are compliant with security policies of the organization.

 *Infrastructure Dependency*
The hybrid cloud model is dependent on internal IT infrastructure, therefore it is necessary to ensure redundancy across data centers.
