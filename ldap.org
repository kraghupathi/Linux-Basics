* LDAP
  -  *LDAP* stands for *Lightweight Directory Access Protocol* which can be used in numerous ways such as for authentication, shared directory (for mail clients), address book, etc. The *LDAP* protocol can be used to establish and store any kind of information. The *OpenLDAP* server gives you the possibility to access the information which is stored in a tree structure.
  -  It is an application protocol used over an IP network to manage and access the distributed directory information service.
  -  The primary purpose of a directory service is to provide a systematic set of records, usually organized in a hierarchical structure.
  -  It's similar to a telephone directory that contains a list of subscribes with thier contact number and address.
  -  In order to commence an LDAP session , a client needs to connect to the server known as the Directory System Agent
  
In this article we will show you how to install and configure an
*OpenLDAP* server and how to administer it with *phpLDAPadmin* on *Debian*,
*Ubuntu* and *Linux Mint* systems.
** Installation Of OpenLDAP Server In Linux
By default the *OpenLDAP* server is in repositories under the package
¡°*slapd*¡°. You can easily install it with the help of package manager
tool called [[http://www.tecmint.com/useful-basic-commands-of-apt-get-and-apt-cache-for-package-management/][apt-get.]] But before installing the *OpenLDAP* server, make sure your system is *up-to-date*.

During installation, it will ask you to enter a password for the *admin* entry in your *LDAP* directory. Enter a strong password and confirm it by selecting *OK.*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install slapd ldap-utils
#+END_EXAMPLE
[[./openldap-620x416.png]]
** Configure OpenLDAP Server
In order to configure the *OpenLDAP* server you need to edit the
*ldap.conf* file, which is stored under the */etc* directory. To edit the
*ldap.conf* file you need a text editor like *vim, nano* etc. Run the
following command to open the *ldap* configuration file for editing.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo nano /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
#+END_EXAMPLE
The output of the above command is shown in the below section.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#
# LDAP Defaults
#

# See ldap.conf(5) for details
# This file should be world readable but not world writable.

#BASE   dc=example,dc=com
#URI    ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666

#SIZELIMIT      12
#TIMELIMIT      15
#DEREF          never

# TLS certificates (needed for GnuTLS)
TLS_CACERT      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
#+END_EXAMPLE
Uncomment the *BASE* and *URI* lines, so you can edit them with your
own *domain name* and *IP address*. Since this is a testing
installation and configuration I will use *tecmint123.com* as my
domain name.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#
# LDAP Defaults
#

# See ldap.conf(5) for details
# This file should be world readable but not world writable.

BASE   dc=tecmint123,dc=com
URI    ldap://ldap.example.com ldap://ldap-master.example.com:666

#SIZELIMIT      12
#TIMELIMIT      15
#DEREF          never

# TLS certificates (needed for GnuTLS)
TLS_CACERT      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
#+END_EXAMPLE
Save the file and run the following command to reconfigure the LDAP package.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd
#+END_EXAMPLE
[[./openldap1-620x415.png]]

To construct the base *DN* of the *LDAP* directory you need a *DNS*
domain name.

[[./openldap2-620x417.png]]

Enter your *DNS* domain name and hit *Enter* to confirm it. Then the
ldap will ask to enter the name of the organization to use in the base
*DN* of your *LDAP* directory. Enter the name of your *company* or
*organisation* and hit *Enter* again.

[[./openldap3-620x414.png]]

After the organisation or company name is added, the package
configuration will ask to enter the *password* for the *admin* entry
in your *LDAP* directory. You need to enter the *password* for the
*admin* which you created in the previous steps.

[[./openldap4-620x415.png]]

After you have confirmed the administrator¡¯s password, you have to
select the *database*. There are two databases to select from, the
*BDB* and *HDB* database. They both support the same configuration
options, use similar storage formats, but since the *HDB* database
adds support for sub-tree renames it is the recommended one.

[[./openldap5-620x416.png]]

You can select the database you think will work better for you. After
you have decided which database you will use, hit *Enter* to confirm the
selection. Then you will be prompted with another question. Select *Yes*
to remove the database when *slapd* is purged.

[[./openldap6-620x415.png]]

Select again *Yes* and press *Enter*.

[[./openldap7-620x415.png]]

Select *No* and the *LDAP* server will start running.

To test the *LDAP* server, the *ldapsearch -x* command is used.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ldapsearch -x

It produces the following output.

** LDAP Administration with phpLDAPadmin
*phpLDAPadmin* is a *GUI* administration tool for *LDAP* server
administration. This *GUI* tool will help us to interact with your *LDAP*
server through a web interface. It is available in the default
repositories, it can be installed with the *apt-get* command.

But before installing *phpLDAPadmin*, you must have *Apache* web server
and *PHP* installed and running. If not, install it using following
command.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 php5-mysql
#+END_EXAMPLE
Next install the ¡°*phpldapadmin*¡± package as shown below.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo apt-get install phpldapadmin
#+END_EXAMPLE
The same way we configured the *ldap.conf* file, we need to configure
the *phpldapadmin* web interface configuration files before using
it. Run the following command to open the phpldapadmin *config.php*
file.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo nano /etc/phpldapadmin/config.php
#+END_EXAMPLE
All you need to do is to replace the *domain names* with your own
values. The configuration part needed for this case is under the
¡°*Define your LDAP servers*¡± section.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$servers = new Datastore();
$servers->newServer('ldap_pla'); 
$servers->setValue('server','name','Tecmint LDAP Server');
$servers->setValue('server','host','127.0.0.1'); 
$servers->setValue('server','base',array('dc=tecmint123,dc=com'));
$servers->setValue('login','bind_id','cn=admin,dc=tecmint123,dc=com');
#+END_EXAMPLE
After you have finished editing the *config.php* configuration file,
open a tab in your web browser and tpye the
¡°*http://ip_address_here/phpldapadmin*¡± *URL*. Enter your ldap login
credentials and click login.
