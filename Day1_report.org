** From 9:30 AM TO 12:30 PM:
- Today I learned basics of Regular Expressions and  basic commands those are
 + '*' (Matches the preceding element zero or more times)
 + '?' (Matches any character zero or one times)
 + '+' (Matches the preceding element one or more times)
- Here iam using these Expressions 
 + To create a directory through command:mkdir dirname
 + To create file in directory through command:touch filename 

** From 2:00 PM TO 6:00 PM:

  Through which I came to learn following commands
*** grep command using Regular Expressions
 + grep : grep 'word' filename
 + grep : grep 'string1 string2' filename
 + grep : grep -r "string" filename
 + grep : grep ^a filename
 + grep : grep a$ filename
 + grep : grep '\+[[[[:alpha:]]]]' * filename
 + grep : grep '[[[[:alpha:]]]]\+' * filename
 + grep : grep '\+[[[[:alpha:]]]]\{3\}' * filename  
 + grep : grep '\+[[[[:alpha:]]]]\{3,\}' * filename
*** sed command using Regular Expressions
- sed is a command, which is used to inline edit the file.
 + sed [option] commands [input-file ]
 + sed - sed -e 's/file1/file2/g' path

*** Pips:
- A Pipe is a way to connect the output of one command to the input of another command.
- And I took learned basic commands of shell using pips, those are
- syntax: command1 | commandd2 
 + ls: ls | wc -l
