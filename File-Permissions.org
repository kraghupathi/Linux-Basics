*** User rights/Permissions
#+begin_example
chmod rwxrwxrwx <filename>
#+end_example
    + The first set of three characters (rwx) is for the owner permissions.
    + The second set of three characters (rwx) is for the Group permissions.
    + The third set of three characters (rwx) is for the All Users permissions.
    - The permission settings as a series of bits. Here's how it works:
    + rwx = 111 in binary = 7 in decimal
    + rw- = 110 in binary = 6 in decimal
    + r-x = 101 in binary = 5 in decimal
    + r-- = 100 in binary = 4 in decimal
    + --x = 001 in binary = 1 in decimal
    + -w- = 010 in binary = 2 in deciaml
    + -wx = 011 in binary = 3 in decimal
#+begin_example
Syntax:- chmod <options> <mode> <files>
chmod 777 filename
#+end_example 

#+begin_example
